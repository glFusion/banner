      <h1>glFusion Banner Plugin Configuration</h1>
      <p>The Banner Plugin allows you to create and display banner ads.  Banners may be displayed within the header and footer templates, as well as in blocks, stories, and static pages.</p>

      <h2>Main Banner Options</h2>

      <dl id="desc_admin_email_addr">
        <dt>Administrator&apos;s Email Address</dt>
        <dd>Enter the email addresses to which confirmation email messages should be sent. If this is empty, the site email address will be used.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl id="desc_templatevariables">
        <dt>Display banners in templates?</dt>
        <dd>Select whether to display banners in templates.  If "No", then no banners will appear in the header or footer templates.<p />
<span style="color:red;">IMPORTANT:</span>  If you enable this function, and you have categories enabled which use any of the standard template names (header, footer, article, etc.), then you MUST make sure that the template variables are defined properly in order to keep your impression count accurate.<p />
The plugin has no way of knowing whether template variables are actually defined, so it counts each attempt to display an ad whether it is actually displayed or not.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_submissionqueue">
        <dt>Enable Submission Queue?</dt>
        <dd>Setting this to "Yes" enables the submission queue.  If this is "No", the submission queue is not used.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_usersubmit">
        <dt>Allow submissions from site members?</dt>
        <dd>Setting this to "Yes" allows site members to submit ads, subject to the "Enable Submission Queue" setting.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_notification">
        <dt>Notification Email?</dt>
        <dd>Set this to "Yes" to have an email message sent to the site admin when a new banner is submitted.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_delete_banner">
        <dt>Delete Banner with Owner?</dt>
        <dd>Set this to "Yes" to have banners deleted when the owner's user account is deleted.  If this is "No", banners will persist after the owner has been removed, and the ownership will change to a member with the "banner.admin" privilege.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_show_in_admin">
        <dt>Show baners on admin pages?</dt>
        <dd>Select whether to display banners on pages under the site admin URL.  If impressions are counted, this should probably be set to "No".</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_target_blank">
        <dt>Show target links in a new window?</dt>
        <dd>If this is "Yes", then clicking on a banner will open the target in a new browser window or tab.  If this is "No", then the target will be opened in the current window, effectively leaving your site.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_img_max_height">
        <dt>Image Max Height</dt>
        <dd>Enter the maximum image height for an uploaded banner image, in pixels.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_img_max_width">
        <dt>Image Max Width</dt>
        <dd>Enter the maximum image width for an uploaded banner image, in pixels.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_def_weight">
        <dt>Default Weight</dt>
        <dd>Select the default weight to be applied to new ads. The weight indicates the liklihood that a banner will be displayed relative to other banners.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Banner Display Settings</h2>

      <p>These settings allow you to block ads from being displayed to various classes of visitor.  Some ad providers, such as Google Adsense, have clauses in their TOS regarding invalid or webmaster-generated impressions.  Setting one or more of the following items can help mitigate this problem.</p>

      <dl id="desc_show_in_admin">
        <dt>Show Banners on Admin Pages?</dt>
        <dd>If this is "Yes", then banners will be displayed on pages under the site admin URL.  If "No", then admin pages will not be shown banners.  This is one method to reduce false impressions due to admin activity.</dd>
      </dd>

      <dl id="desc_ipaddr_dontshow">
        <dt>IP addresses that will not be shown ads</dt>
        <dd>Enter one or more IP addresses that will not be shown ads.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_uagent_dontshow">
        <dt>User Agents that will not be shown ads</dt>
        <dd>Enter one or more User Agent strings that will not be shown ads. You can enter a substring, e.g. &quot;Mozilla&quote; to catch all versions of Mozilla browsers. The user-agent string is not case-sensitive. This is typically used to prevent monitoring systems (Nagios, Xymon, etc.) from increasing the ad hit counts.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_adshow_owner">
        <dt>Show ads to the ad owner?</dt>
        <dd>Set this to "No" to hide ads from their owner.  If this is "Yes", then the ad owners will see their own ads.  Since the impression and click counters can be controlled by other settings, this is most useful if your site uses Adsense or similar ads to prevent false impression counts.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_adshow_admins">
        <dt>Show ads to ad administrators?</dt>
        <dd>Set this to "No" to hide all ads from the banner ad administrators (members with the 'banner.admin' privilege.  For these users, this "No" setting will override a "Yes" setting for "Show ads to the ad owner".  If this is "Yes", then the administrators will see ads.  Set "Show ads to the ad owner" to "No" to prevent administrators from seeing their own ads.  Since the impression and click counters can be controlled by other settings, this is most useful if your site uses Adsense or similar ads to prevent false impression counts.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_cntclicks_owner">
        <dt>Count ad clicks made by the ad owner?</dt>
        <dd>If this is set to "No", then clicks made by the ad owners will not count towards their hit counts.  If this is "Yes", then clicks made by ad owners will be added to the ad's hit count.  This almost certainly should be set to "No".</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_cntclicks_admins">
        <dt>Count ad clicks made by ad administrators?</dt>
        <dd>If this is set to "No", then clicks made by the ad administrators will not count towards their hit counts.  If this is "Yes", then clicks made by administrators will be added to the ad's hit count.  This probably should be set to "No".</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_cntimpr_owner">
        <dt>Count ad impressions for the ad owner?</dt>
        <dd>If this is set to "No", then the ad impression count is not incremented when the ad is displayed to its owner.  If this is "Yes", then the display will be added to the ad's impression count.  This almost certainly should be set to "No".</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_cntimpr_admins">
        <dt>Count ad impressions for ad administrators?</dt>
        <dd>If this is set to "No", then the ad impression count is not incremented when the ad is displayed to an ad administrator. If this is "Yes", then the display will be added to the ad's impression count.  This probably should be set to "No".</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_cb_enable">
        <dt>Centerblock Enabled?</dt>
        <dd>If this is set to "Yes", then ads which belong to categories that have "Show in Centerblock" set to "true" will be displayed in a center block according to the "Centerblock Position" setting.  Setting this to "No" suppresses the banner ad centerbock.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_cb_pos">
        <dt>Centerblock Position?</dt>
        <dd>Select the position where the center block should appear.  This has no effect unless the centerblock is enabled.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_cb_home">
        <dt>Centerblock Replaces Home Page?</dt>
        <dd>If this is set to "Yes", then the site home page will be replaced by a single banner ad.  Note that this may conflict with other plugins, so all other plugins should have their centerblock turned off if this is to be used.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_block_limit">
        <dt>Max. ads to show in blocks</dt>
        <dd>This is the maximum number of ads to show in blocks.  Enter "0" for no limit.  The default random ad block is limited to a single ad, but other blocks may display one or more ads.</dd>
